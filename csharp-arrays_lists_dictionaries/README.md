# C# - Data Structures: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries

### Task 0
To create an array of ints : `int[] newArray = new int[size];`.

### Task 1
To retrieve an element of an array : `array[index]`.

### Task 2
To replace an element in an array : `array[index] = n;`.

### Task 3
There is a difference between a null array and an array that is empty.<br>
`int[] array2 = null;` is null. Whereas `int[] array3 = {};` simply has a length of 0.<br>
In both cases, and for any arrays, you can't change its size after initialization.
